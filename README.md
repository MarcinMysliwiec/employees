# Employees v1.0.0

Hi! This is my recent **recruitment task implementation**.

This task involves [dummyapis API](https://dummyapis.com/dummy/employee), it's purpose is to list all employees fetched from database and show their details, after clicking **"read more"** button.

## Allowed routes:

List **<em>all</em>** employees (paginated)

	> https://employees.mysliw.pl
    > or
	> https://employees.mysliw.pl/:page

Show details of user with given **<em>id</em>**

	> https://employees.mysliw.pl/details/:id
